# Temporal Lab for Beginners

## Introduction to Temporal

Temporal is an open-source workflow orchestration platform designed to build and manage durable, scalable, and fault-tolerant applications. It allows developers to write complex business logic as workflows that can span days, weeks, or even months, with built-in features like retries, timeouts, and state management. Temporal is particularly useful for microservices, serverless architectures, and long-running processes.

### Three Basic Components of Temporal
1. **Workflow**: The core unit of execution that defines the business logic and sequence of tasks. Workflows are durable, meaning their state is preserved and can be recovered even if a process fails.
2. **Activity**: Individual tasks or units of work within a workflow, such as calling an API, processing data, or sending an email. Activities are executed by workers and can be retried if they fail.
3. **Worker**: A process that runs workflow and activity code, polling the Temporal Server for tasks and executing them. Workers are typically written using a Temporal SDK (e.g., in Go, Java, or Python).

Understanding these components is key to leveraging Temporal‚Äôs architecture. This lab will help you set up a basic Temporal environment and explore its features.

## Lab Goals
The purpose of this lab is to:
- Understand Temporal's architecture and its basic components.
- Set up a Temporal Server using Docker Compose.
- Explore the Web UI at `localhost:8233`.
- Register a namespace using the Temporal CLI.

This simple lab uses only the `temporalio/admin-tools` Docker image, which includes the Temporal Server, CLI commands, and a minimal functioning Web UI, making it ideal for beginners without the complexity of additional databases or services.


# Introduction to Temporal - Docker Setup

This project demonstrates how to set up and explore Temporal's workflow orchestration platform using Docker Compose. Temporal is a durable workflow execution platform that helps build reliable distributed applications.


## üöÄ Quick Start

### Create Docker Compose File

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  temporal:
    image: temporalio/admin-tools:latest
    ports:
      - "7233:7233"
      - "8233:8233"
    entrypoint: []
    command: ["temporal", "server", "start-dev", "--ui-port", "8233", "--ip", "0.0.0.0"]
```

### Start Temporal Server

```bash
# Start Temporal using Docker Compose
docker-compose up

# Or run in background
docker-compose up -d
```


### Access Web UI

Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:8233

You should see the Temporal Web UI dashboard.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
temporal-docker-setup/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml      # Docker Compose configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/              # Sample workflows (optional)
```

## üîß Configuration Details

### Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  temporal:
    image: temporalio/admin-tools:latest
    ports:
      - "7233:7233"
      - "8233:8233"
    entrypoint: []
    command: ["temporal", "server", "start-dev", "--ui-port", "8233", "--ip", "0.0.0.0"]
```

### Configuration Breakdown:

- **Image**: `temporalio/admin-tools:latest` - Official Temporal tools image with CLI included
- **Ports**:
  - `7233`: Temporal Server API endpoint
  - `8233`: Web UI dashboard
- **Entrypoint**: Cleared to override default behavior
- **Command**: Starts Temporal in development mode with Web UI

### Why These Settings?

- `--ui-port 8233`: Specifies Web UI port
- `--ip 0.0.0.0`: Binds to all interfaces (required for Docker port mapping)
- `start-dev`: Uses in-memory database (perfect for learning)

## üåê Accessing Services

### Temporal Server

- **URL**: http://localhost:7233
- **Purpose**: API endpoint for workflow operations
- **Test**: `curl http://localhost:7233/api/v1/namespaces`

### Temporal Web UI

- **URL**: http://localhost:8233
- **Purpose**: Visual dashboard for monitoring workflows
- **Features**:
  - View workflow executions
  - Monitor task queues
  - Explore workflow history
  - Debug failed workflows

## üè∑ Working with Namespaces

Namespaces provide isolation for different environments or applications. The Temporal CLI is already included in the Docker container.

### View Default Namespace

```bash
# List all namespaces
docker-compose exec temporal temporal namespace list

# Describe the default namespace
docker-compose exec temporal temporal namespace describe --namespace default
```

### Register a New Namespace

```bash
# Register a new namespace
docker-compose exec temporal temporal namespace register --namespace my-app

# Register with retention period
docker-compose exec temporal temporal namespace register \
  --namespace my-app \
  --retention 72h \
  --description "My application namespace"
```

### Namespace Operations

```bash
# List all namespaces
docker-compose exec temporal temporal namespace list

# Get namespace details
docker-compose exec temporal temporal namespace describe --namespace my-app

# Update namespace retention
docker-compose exec temporal temporal namespace update \
  --namespace my-app \
  --retention 168h
```

## üîç Exploring the Web UI

### Dashboard Overview

Navigate to http://localhost:8233
Default view shows the namespace selector

**Key sections**:
- Workflows: View running and completed workflows
- Task Queues: Monitor work distribution
- Namespaces: Switch between different environments
- Cluster: Server health and configuration

### Web UI Features

#### Workflow Monitoring
- View workflow execution history
- Monitor workflow status and progress
- Inspect activity results and failures
- Trace workflow execution timeline

#### Task Queue Management
- Monitor task queue health
- View pending and completed tasks
- Check worker connectivity
- Analyze task processing metrics

#### Namespace Management
- Switch between namespaces
- View namespace configuration
- Monitor namespace-specific metrics

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Container Won't Start

```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View detailed logs
docker-compose logs
```

üßπ Cleanup
Stop Services
# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (clears all data)
docker-compose down -v

Remove Images
# Remove Temporal images
docker rmi temporalio/admin-tools:latest

# Clean up unused images
docker system prune

üìö What's Next?
