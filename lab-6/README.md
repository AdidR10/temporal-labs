# Lab 6: Cron Scheduling & External Triggers

**Goal:** Build sophisticated external integration systems using cron scheduling, HTTP triggers, and real-time signal communication.

## Features
- Define cron-scheduled workflows for automated execution
- Create HTTP endpoints for external system integration
- Use signals for real-time communication with running workflows
- Implement multi-trigger workflow architectures
- Handle external events and webhook integrations
- Manage schedule lifecycle programmatically

## Quick Start

1. **Start Services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access Services:**
   - **Temporal Web UI**: [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233)
   - **FastAPI Interface**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

3. **Test HTTP Trigger:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/trigger-workflow/test-001?name=Quick%20Start"
   ```

4. **Create Cron Schedule:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/test-schedule?cron=*/1%20*%20*%20*%20*"
   ```

## How it Works
- FastAPI service provides HTTP endpoints for external integration
- Workflows can be triggered via HTTP requests, cron schedules, or CLI commands
- Running workflows receive real-time signals from external systems
- Schedule management enables automated recurring workflow execution
- Multiple trigger types allow flexible integration patterns

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- **Master cron scheduling**: Create and manage automated recurring workflows with precise timing control
- **Build HTTP integrations**: Design REST APIs that bridge external systems with Temporal workflows
- **Implement real-time signals**: Enable external systems to communicate with running workflows asynchronously
- **Design multi-trigger architectures**: Create workflows that can be started through multiple different mechanisms
- **Handle external events**: Process webhooks, API calls, and other external triggers in workflow systems
- **Manage schedule lifecycles**: Programmatically create, modify, pause, and delete workflow schedules

## 📚 Background

### Why External Integration Matters

Modern applications exist in **complex ecosystems** where workflows must interact with multiple external systems, respond to real-time events, and execute on predetermined schedules. External integration capabilities are essential for building production-ready workflow systems.

### Workflow Integration Benefits

#### Multi-Modal Triggering
- **Flexibility**: Workflows can be started via HTTP, schedules, CLI, or other workflows
- **External Coupling**: External systems can initiate workflows without direct temporal knowledge
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Respond to external events as they occur
- **Hybrid Patterns**: Combine scheduled and event-driven execution in single workflows

#### Real-Time Communication
- **Asynchronous Signals**: External systems send data without blocking workflow execution
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Workflows adapt based on incoming external events
- **Bidirectional Flow**: Workflows can query external systems and receive updates
- **Event Aggregation**: Collect multiple external events before processing

#### Automated Scheduling
- **Cron Precision**: Execute workflows at specific times using familiar cron syntax
- **Reliable Execution**: Built-in retry mechanisms for failed scheduled executions
- **Schedule Management**: Create, modify, and delete schedules programmatically
- **Timezone Handling**: Proper handling of timezone-aware scheduling

#### Production Integration
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful interfaces for external system communication
- **Webhook Support**: Handle incoming webhooks from external services
- **Authentication**: Secure integration with proper access control
- **Monitoring**: Track external triggers and schedule execution

### Architecture Patterns
#### Pattern 1: HTTP Trigger (On-Demand)
```
User/System → HTTP Request → FastAPI → Starts Workflow
  "Process this order"        ↓
                        Temporal Workflow
                        "Order processing..."
```

#### Pattern 2: Cron Schedule (Time-Based)
```
Clock → Every 5 minutes → Temporal Scheduler → Starts Workflow
     "It's time!"                     ↓
                               Temporal Workflow
                               "Daily report..."
```

#### Pattern 3: Signal Communication (Real-Time)
```
External System → HTTP Request → FastAPI → Sends Signal → Running Workflow
  "Update status"              ↓                    ↓
                        "Signal sent"      "Got the update!"
```

#### Pattern 4: Multi-Trigger (Flexible)
```
Same Workflow Can Be Started By:
├── HTTP Request (immediate)
├── Cron Schedule (automatic)
├── Signal Input (while running)
└── Manual CLI (testing)
```

```

## 📁 Project Structure

You'll work with the following structure in your lab-6 directory:

```
lab-6/
├── docker-compose.yml          # Multi-service configuration
├── requirements.txt            # Python dependencies
├── Dockerfile                 # Container configuration
└── app/
    ├── __init__.py            # Package initialization
    ├── cronWorkflow.py        # Signal-enabled workflow with cron support
    ├── main.py               # FastAPI endpoints for external integration
    ├── worker.py             # Worker service
    ├── activity.py           # Activity definitions
    └── Dockerfile            # App-specific container config
```

## 🚀 Lab Implementation

### Step 1: Set Up Project Structure

Open VS Code terminal in Poridhi Lab and navigate to your lab-6 directory:

```bash
# Navigate to lab-6 directory
cd lab-6

# Verify the app directory exists
ls -la app/
```

### Step 2: Understand the Docker Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` configures a multi-service architecture:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  temporal:
    image: temporalio/admin-tools:latest
    ports:
      - "7233:7233"  # Temporal Server gRPC
      - "8233:8233"  # Web UI
    entrypoint: []
    command: ["temporal", "server", "start-dev", "--ui-port", "8233", "--ip", "0.0.0.0"]
    networks:
      - temporal-net     # attach to the shared network

  worker:
    build: .
    command: ["python", "-u", "worker.py"]
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app/
    environment:
      - TEMPORAL_ADDRESS=temporal:7233
      - TASK_QUEUE=cron-task-queue
    depends_on:
      - temporal
    networks:
      - temporal-net     # attach to the shared network

  api:
    build: .
    command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app/
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - TEMPORAL_ADDRESS=temporal:7233
    depends_on:
      - temporal
    networks:
      - temporal-net     # attach to the shared network

networks:
  temporal-net:          # declares the network so Docker Compose creates it
    driver: bridge       # default driver (could omit—bridge is the default)
```

### Step 3: Examine the Signal-Enabled Workflow Implementation

The `app/cronWorkflow.py` demonstrates multi-trigger workflow architecture:

```python
# shared/workflow.py
from datetime import timedelta
from temporalio import workflow

@workflow.defn
class CronWorkflow:  # Better name - describes what it does
    def __init__(self):
        self.messages = []        # Collect signals from external systems
        self.should_stop = False  # External stop control
    
    @workflow.signal
    async def add_message(self, message: str):
        """External services can send data via this signal"""
        self.messages.append(message)
    
    @workflow.signal  
    async def stop_processing(self):
        """External services can stop the workflow"""
        self.should_stop = True
    
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, task_name: str) -> dict:
        """
        This workflow can be:
        1. Scheduled with cron (e.g., daily at 9am)
        2. Triggered manually via HTTP
        3. Receive signals while running
        """
        workflow.logger.info(f"Processing task: {task_name}")
        
        # Wait for signals or timeout
        await workflow.wait_condition(
            lambda: self.should_stop or len(self.messages) >= 5,
            timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
        )   
        
        # Process collected messages
        processed_count = len(self.messages)
        
        return {
            "task": task_name,
            "messages_processed": processed_count,
            "messages": self.messages,
            "completed_at": str(workflow.now())
        }
```

#### Key Concepts Demonstrated

| Component | Purpose | Code Pattern |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Signal Handlers** | External system communication | `@workflow.signal` for `add_message` and `stop_processing` |
| **Event Aggregation** | Collect multiple external events | `wait_condition()` with threshold (`>= 5`) or timeout (`30s`) |
| **Graceful Termination** | External stop control | `should_stop` flag controlled by signal |
| **Multi-Trigger Support** | Various initiation methods | HTTP, cron, CLI triggers for same workflow |
| **Simple Message Storage** | Collect signals from external systems | `self.messages.append(message)` |
| **Conditional Processing** | Wait for events or timeout | `lambda: self.should_stop or len(self.messages) >= 5` |

### Step 4: Examine the FastAPI Integration Service

The `app/main.py` provides HTTP endpoints for external integration:

```python
# api/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from temporalio.client import Client
from cronWorkflow import CronWorkflow
from datetime import datetime

app = FastAPI()
client = None

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup():
    import os
    global client
    temporal_address = os.getenv("TEMPORAL_ADDRESS", "temporal:7233")
    client = await Client.connect(temporal_address)

# 1. Regular HTTP trigger
@app.post("/trigger-workflow/{workflow_id}")
async def trigger_workflow(workflow_id: str, name: str = "HTTP Triggered"):
    """Trigger workflow from HTTP endpoint"""
    try:
        handle = await client.start_workflow(
            CronWorkflow.run,
            name,
            id=workflow_id,  
            task_queue="lab6-queue",
        )
        return {"workflow_id": handle.id, "status": "started"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))

# 2. Create cron schedule
@app.post("/schedule-workflow/{schedule_id}")
async def schedule_workflow(schedule_id: str, cron: str = "* * * * *"):
    """Schedule workflow with cron expression"""
    
    try:
        from datetime import datetime
        from temporalio.client import Schedule, ScheduleActionStartWorkflow, ScheduleSpec

        await client.create_schedule(
            schedule_id,
            Schedule(
                action=ScheduleActionStartWorkflow(
                    CronWorkflow.run,
                    "Cron Triggered",
                    id=f"cron-{datetime.now().timestamp()}",
                    task_queue="lab6-queue",
                ),
                spec=ScheduleSpec(
                    cron_expressions=[cron],
                ),
            ),
        )
        return {"schedule_id": schedule_id, "cron": cron, "status": "scheduled"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))

@app.delete("/schedule-workflow/{schedule_id}")
async def delete_schedule(schedule_id: str):
    """Delete (stop) a cron schedule"""
    try:
        handle = client.get_schedule_handle(schedule_id)
        await handle.delete()
        return {"schedule_id": schedule_id, "status": "deleted"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=str(e))

# 3. Signal workflow from external service
@app.post("/signal-workflow/{workflow_id}")
async def signal_workflow(workflow_id: str, message: str):
    """Send signal to running workflow"""
    try:
        handle = client.get_workflow_handle(workflow_id)
        await handle.signal(CronWorkflow.add_message, message)
        return {"workflow_id": workflow_id, "signal": "sent", "message": message}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=str(e))

@app.post("/stop-workflow/{workflow_id}")
async def stop_workflow(workflow_id: str):
    """Send stop signal to workflow"""
    try:
        handle = client.get_workflow_handle(workflow_id)
        await handle.signal(CronWorkflow.stop_processing)
        return {"workflow_id": workflow_id, "signal": "stop sent"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=str(e))

@app.get("/workflow-result/{workflow_id}")
async def get_result(workflow_id: str):
    """Get workflow result"""
    try:
        handle = client.get_workflow_handle(workflow_id)
        result = await handle.result()
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=str(e))
```

### Step 5: Deploy and Configure Load Balancer

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build -d

# Verify all containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Check service logs
docker-compose logs -f api
docker-compose logs -f worker
```

#### Configure Load Balancer
1. Get your lab instance IP: `ifconfig eth0`
2. **Create Load Balancer for Temporal Web UI**:
   - **Enter IP**: Your lab instance eth0 IP address
   - **Enter Port**: `8233`
   - **Click Create**
3. **Create Load Balancer for FastAPI**:
   - **Enter IP**: Your lab instance eth0 IP address
   - **Enter Port**: `8000`
   - **Click Create**

### Step 6: Test HTTP Workflow Triggers

Test direct workflow triggering via HTTP endpoints:

```bash
# Trigger a workflow with custom parameters
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/trigger-workflow/http-test-001?name=HTTP%20Integration%20Test"

# Verify response contains workflow details
# Expected: {"workflow_id": "http-test-001", "status": "started"}
```

**Important**: Note the **Workflow ID** for monitoring in the Web UI!

### Step 7: Implement Cron Scheduling

Create automated recurring workflows:

```bash
# Create a schedule that runs every minute
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/every-minute?cron=*%20*%20*%20*%20*"

# Create a schedule that runs every 5 minutes
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/every-5-min?cron=*/5%20*%20*%20*%20*"

# Create a schedule for business hours (9 AM - 5 PM, weekdays)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/business-hours?cron=0%209-17%20*%20*%201-5"

# Expected response: {"schedule_id": "every-minute", "cron": "* * * * *", "status": "scheduled"}
```

### Step 8: Test Real-Time Signal Communication

Test dynamic signal sending to running workflows:

```bash
# Start a long-running workflow
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/trigger-workflow/signal-test-001?name=Signal%20Communication%20Test"

# Send multiple messages to the running workflow
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/signal-workflow/signal-test-001?message=First%20external%20event%20from%20API"

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/signal-workflow/signal-test-001?message=Second%20external%20event%20from%20API"

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/signal-workflow/signal-test-001?message=Third%20external%20event%20from%20API"

# Check workflow status
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/workflow-result/signal-test-001"

# Expected signal response: {"workflow_id": "signal-test-001", "signal": "sent", "message": "First external event from API"}
```

### Step 9: Monitor in Web UI

1. **Open Temporal Web UI**: Use your load balancer URL (port 8233)
2. **Navigate to Workflows**: Click "Workflows" in sidebar
3. **Find HTTP-Triggered Workflows**: Look for workflows with your custom IDs
4. **Navigate to Schedules**: Click "Schedules" in sidebar
5. **Monitor Schedule Execution**: View schedule triggers and executions

#### What to Look For in Web UI

##### Workflow Execution View
- **Trigger Type**: HTTP-triggered vs Cron-triggered workflows
- **Signal Events**: SignalReceived events in workflow history
- **Query Events**: External status checks
- **Execution Duration**: Time from start to completion

##### Schedule Management View
- **Schedule Status**: Active, paused, or deleted schedules
- **Next Execution**: Upcoming schedule triggers
- **Execution History**: Past schedule-triggered workflows
- **Cron Expression**: Configured scheduling patterns

### Step 10: Test Schedule Lifecycle Management

Test complete schedule management:

```bash
# Create a test schedule
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/lifecycle-test?cron=*/2%20*%20*%20*%20*"

# Wait for schedule to trigger (2 minutes)
sleep 130

# Check for triggered workflows in Web UI
# Look for workflows with name "Cron Triggered"

# Delete the schedule
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/lifecycle-test"

# Verify schedule is deleted
docker-compose exec temporal temporal schedule list | grep lifecycle-test || echo "Schedule successfully deleted"
```

## 🔍 Understanding External Integration Patterns

### Multi-Trigger Architecture Analysis

#### Integration Benefits
- **Flexible Initiation**: Multiple ways to start the same workflow logic
- **External Decoupling**: External systems don't need Temporal knowledge
- **Event Aggregation**: Collect and process multiple external events
- **Real-Time Response**: Immediate reaction to external triggers

#### Trigger Type Comparison
```
HTTP Trigger     ├─ Immediate execution
                 ├─ External system initiated
                 ├─ Request-response pattern
                 └─ On-demand processing

Cron Schedule    ├─ Time-based execution
                 ├─ System initiated
                 ├─ Recurring pattern
                 └─ Automated processing

Signal Input     ├─ Real-time communication
                 ├─ External event driven
                 ├─ Asynchronous pattern
                 └─ Dynamic behavior
```

### Signal Communication Strategies

#### Event Aggregation Techniques

| Technique | Implementation | Use Case |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Threshold-Based** | `len(messages) >= 5` | Batch processing |
| **Time-Based** | `timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)` | Maximum wait time |
| **Signal-Based** | `should_stop` flag | External control |
| **Condition-Based** | `wait_condition()` | Complex logic |

#### Communication Patterns
- **Fire-and-Forget**: Send signal without waiting for response
- **Request-Response**: Send signal and wait for workflow completion
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Multiple workflows receive same signal
- **Event Sourcing**: Signals become part of workflow history

## 🧪 Experimentation

### Try These Variations

#### 1. Complex Cron Schedules
Test advanced scheduling patterns:
```bash
# Every weekday at 9 AM
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/weekday-morning?cron=0%209%20*%20*%201-5"

# Every 15 minutes during business hours
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/business-frequent?cron=*/15%209-17%20*%20*%201-5"

# First day of every month at midnight
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/monthly-report?cron=0%200%201%20*%20*"
```

#### 2. Batch Signal Processing
Modify workflow to process signals in batches:
```python
@workflow.run
async def run(self, task_name: str) -> dict:
    while not self.should_stop:
        # Wait for batch of messages
        await workflow.wait_condition(
            lambda: len(self.messages) >= 10 or self.should_stop,
            timeout=timedelta(minutes=5)
        )
        
        # Process batch
        if self.messages:
            batch = self.messages[:10]
            self.messages = self.messages[10:]
            await workflow.execute_activity("process_batch", batch)
```

#### 3. Multi-Workflow Coordination
Create workflows that signal other workflows:
```python
@workflow.run
async def coordinator_workflow(self, child_workflow_ids: list) -> dict:
    # Start child workflows
    for workflow_id in child_workflow_ids:
        await client.start_workflow(
            CronWorkflow.run,
            f"Child {workflow_id}",
            id=workflow_id,
            task_queue="lab6-queue"
        )
    
    # Signal all children
    for workflow_id in child_workflow_ids:
        handle = client.get_workflow_handle(workflow_id)
        await handle.signal(CronWorkflow.add_message, "Coordinator message")
```

#### 4. Webhook Integration
Add webhook endpoints to FastAPI service:
```python

### Performance Testing

#### Load Testing HTTP Triggers
```bash
# Test concurrent HTTP triggers
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/trigger-workflow/load-test-$i?name=Load%20Test%20$i" &
done
wait
```

#### High-Frequency Scheduling
```bash
# Test frequent schedule (every 30 seconds)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/high-freq?cron=*/30%20*%20*%20*%20*"

# Monitor worker performance
docker-compose logs -f worker
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### HTTP Endpoints Not Responding
```bash
# Check FastAPI service status
docker-compose logs api

# Verify service is running
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Check port binding
docker-compose ps api
```

#### Schedules Not Triggering
```bash
# List all schedules
docker-compose exec temporal temporal schedule list

# Check specific schedule
docker-compose exec temporal temporal schedule describe --schedule-id <schedule-id>

# Verify cron expression
echo "*/5 * * * *" | curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/test-cron?cron=$(cat)"
```

#### Signals Not Reaching Workflows
```bash
# Check if workflow is running
curl http://localhost:8000/workflow-result/<workflow-id>

# Verify signal in Web UI
# Navigate to workflow → History → Look for SignalReceived events

# Check worker logs
docker-compose logs worker | grep signal
```

#### Worker Overload
```bash
# Monitor worker performance
docker-compose exec worker top

# Check concurrent workflow count
docker-compose exec temporal temporal workflow list --namespace default | wc -l
```

## 🧹 Cleanup

```bash
# Stop all running workflows
docker-compose exec temporal temporal workflow terminate \
  --workflow-id signal-test-001 \
  --reason "Lab completed" \
  --namespace default

# Delete all schedules
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/every-minute"
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/every-5-min"
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/schedule-workflow/business-hours"

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Clean up resources
docker-compose down -v
docker system prune -a
```

**Remove Load Balancers**: Delete both load balancer configurations (ports 8233 and 8000) in Poridhi Lab interface.
